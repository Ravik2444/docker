What is Docker?
Docker is a computer program that performs operating-system-level virtualization also known as containerization.

Docker comes with two edition-
- Community   : Free and open source.
- Enterprise  : Chargeable with additional features.

# sudo usermod -a -G docker user_name >> This will add user name in docker group, so sudo permission is not  required.
# docker version > Display the docker version.
# docker info
# docker -v
# docker run hello-world
# docker cntainer run nginx
# docker container stop nginx
# docker container rm nginx
> Stop the container before deleting it.

Storage Drivers:
Docker automatically selects a default storage driver that is compatible with our environment.
- overlay2: File-based storage
- devicemapper: better for lots of writing in the disk.
Default storage driver of docker can be changed by updating the file in /etc/docker/daemon.json.

{
 "storage-driver": "devicemapper"
}
# Restart the docker service:  sudo systemctl restart docker.   >> check docker info and storage-driver.

Docker command syntax:
docker run [options] image[:TAG][COMMAND][ARG...]
If we want to run NGINX with some specific version, we take help of tag.
# docker run nginx:1.15.11    >>  1.15.11 is the version of the image that we want to download.
# docker run busybox echo hello world!    >> busybox is an image to run the command.
options:
-d : Run container in detaiched mode. docker run command will be completed immediately.
--name: specific name given by the user. default is given by the docker engine.
docker container stop container_ID    >> stop the container.
docker run -d --name nginx --restart no nginx
--restart options:
1. no(default) : never restart the container.
2. on-failure: only if the container fails.
3. always: always restart the container wheather it succeeds or fails. Also start the container on daemon startup.
4. unless-stopped: Always restart the container wheather it succeeds or fails, and on daemon startup, unless the container was manually stopped.

-p <host port>:<container port> : Expose the container port by mapping it to a port on the host. We can use -p multiple time to map multiple ports.
--rm automatically remove the container when it exits. Can not be used with --restart.
--memory 500M : This is the hard limit in memory reservation. Docker will not allow more than this memory.
--memory-reservation: A soft limit on memory usage.






docker info: Display all the docker info including storage drivers.
